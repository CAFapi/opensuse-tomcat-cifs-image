# openSUSE with Java, Tomcat and CIFS image

This project builds on the openSUSE Tomcat image [here](https://github.com/CAFapi/opensuse-tomcat-image) to build a pre-configured Tomcat Docker image that has the CIFS utilities pre-installed.

It can be used as a base image for hosting web projects which use Java technologies such as Java Servlets or JavaServer Pages and also require the CIFS utilites installed.
